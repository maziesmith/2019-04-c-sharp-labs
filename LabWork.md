## SQL Lab Work

### SQL Exam Answer Verification Application

Create a console app with an NUnit test which can test the predicted output of the first SQL question in the SQL quiz.  The app runs and asks for the SQL input which is pasted into the screen, then the user is informed if the code is correct or not.  Stretch exercise - can we repeat the same thing using WPF app with text blocks where the SQL code is placed inside a text block, then a button is pressed to determine if the answer is correct or not.

### Rabbit Population Explosion

Population Explosion Project For Today

We are going to build together a population explosion app with Rabbits!!!

Every second a rabbit will spawn exactly one other rabbit, so one will become two, two will become four etc.

I would like you to create a test which will test that after x seconds we expect y rabbits, and firstly create the test (TDD).

Then code against it to solve the puzzle.

Note that I am not just looking for integers to be multiplied; I would actually like rabbit objects to be created and added to a collection of rabbits, say a list for example.

The goal would be to create the test with NUNIT then code this out firstly in a console app, then also a WPF app, then possibly as a 'stretch' exercise to code this as a web application starting out with straightforward 'Web Forms' app (not MVC at present)
