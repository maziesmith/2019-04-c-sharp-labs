Communication : Email

Business Email

Hi

I’m enquiring about possible courses in C# with Sparta.

My background is Civil Engineering and I have recently graduated with a 2:2 from Brunel University last year.

I enclose my CV and look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you

Philip Anderson





Friendly email


Hi 

Great to see you in class yesterday; hope things went well.

How did the Treehouse go?

Thanks

Phil

??



Send 2 emails


1.	Friendly asking for something

2.	Business : manager : time off




Whatsapp

	Great for quick, instant communication, team spirit 


Microsoft Teams

	Chat : Business app : keep spelling and grammar good; otherwise no particular rules

	Group Chat: professional environment 



Managing emails

	Inbox 			==> actionble email (ie something to do or reply)

		> Topic1

		> Topic2

		> Topic3

		> Archive 

		Trash


	Good practice : daily go through emails and try and ignore them while you want to do 'useful work'

		((Batch replies : until you've finished your 'useful work' for the day))

		Study time : 

			'Go dark' and not reply to ANY EMAILS until 3pm 

			Bad : study day : 9am reply to email ==> a) ask to do work
							         b) distraction (trivia)
								 c) disturb YOUR FOCUS

		Try not to let email 'rule your life' by 'always-on', must-instant-reply !!!


	THINK ABOUT !!!

		INBOX ZERO : keep inbox clear!!!

		?? Work from oldest emails up ??




Use of English

	
	Grammar : learn how to use English grammar correctly 

	Spelling : learn and increase your learning !  


Delicate or sensitive matters

	Write once, not send then reread carefully either straight away or, better, after a pause.



Time Management

	Under-promise, over-deliver

	Always assume things will take longer than you might initially plan

	Big task

		Break down : Prioritise


		Eisenhower Model

						Urgent			

			Important		Necessity (fighting fires!)			(High) Quality 
												(life-enhancing
												work lives here)


						Urgent, Not important				Not important
						(Deception) - time wasters			Not urgent
												(Waste) of time!

			

	Pareto Principle

		20% of effort can produce 80% of desired results

	Time Boxing

		Putting a time limit on task : psychologically can trigger more effective work



	Task management 

		If it takes less than 2 minutes, DO IT!!!


		To Do Lists!!!


			1. Capture Tasks : phone calls, emails, chat etc ==> INTO ONE PLACE!!!

			2. Organise : Prioritise Tasks and Your Day

				Calendar : (Google calendar ==> alerts & emails!!!)

				Daily : Write out tasks for day  (night before or first thing)

			3  Do IT!!!!

				In order !!!

				Projects

					1) Plan well

					2) Track progress

					3) Report on progress



	Exam : Time Management main points/categories

		1) Timeboxing
		2) Measuring/Recording tasks and progress
		3) Effective Meetings (at work)

			Developers : Daily 'stand-up'  (10-15 min max total time)

					Everyone : What you did (yesterday), Doing (today), Blocker/hindrances

			Planned meeting : invite people carefully, agenda, minutes, report on outcomes and actions
			




Progress At The Academy

	Lominger 	

		Score behaviour

			Behaviour (actions)

			Technical Knowledge

		Problem Solving : how to fix stuff/problems - many ways!!! be creative!

	


	Coding

		Functionality : Does code work???

		Readability : does code read well visually? appropriate comments?

		Reuse/Maintain

			DRY Don't Repeat Yourself!

				Loop 1 to 100

				Loop 1 to 1000


				or (better)				

				Loop(1 to max)

		Communication of key facts

	Influence : persuasion : show others your point of view 

		Stakeholder : any person with an interest in our project

			Customer (ordering the work) , Directors, Employees, Managers
			End user, competition, Media, 

			If project is run by government/council ==> general public, activist

	Good presentation

		1. Intro
		2. Outline
		3. Topics
			
					Report vs Powerpoint
			
						Report : rule of 5 : Intro, Backgound to topic, 
							Transition into details, Fine detail, conclusion

						Powerpoint : rule of 3 : 3 sections/slides per topic

	KISS : Keep It Simple, Stupid!!!

	Tips for newbies

		Bottle of water : 'pause time' 

		Humour!
	


Project Management

	BAU Business As Usual		Regular run-of-mill-work

	Projects

		Unique
		Transient
					Inserted into workplace with definite goal
		
		Clear aim

			Phases

			Specialists

			Involve complexity

	Constraints on a project

		1) Balance 		TIME       vs         QUALITY           vs       COST


	POPIT IT Model

					people

			  		IT
			
			processes		 organisation
			(flow of work)            (company)






		

IT Projects : Examples of SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle

	Waterfall : simple, fixed projects

		First IT projects like this
		Fixed, unchanging : List of Requirements, Analyse, Design, Build, Test, Release	
		Good for manufacturing / military / small projects	
		
		V-model
			Waterfall + Extra Testing for mission-critical projects

	Agile : changing projects

		Check ' Agile Manifesto '
		
		IT : spectacular fails!!!  Design : too big + whole project : takes too long!!!	

		Solution : Don't design project fully in intricate detail up front.  Only design
			first simple prototype (( MVP Minimum Viable Product ))  (Sprint 1)
			Then => Sprint 2 : Add an INCREMENT OF FUNCTIONALITY!!!
			Sprint 3 : Next iteration etc
		
		Scrum : work in short increments (sprints)

			3-9 developers
			Daily 'stand up'
			Sprint is a focused piece of work

	Kanban : continuous flow

		Car manufacturing is 24/7

		Some industries better with 'flow' of work non-stop.

			Kanban 'board' list of tasks but limit 'number of tasks in progress at any
				one time'


	
	Proposing a new project

		Risk

			% chance that something will go wrong

				% Probability 'x' which will result in loss of impact 'y'

				20% chance market will collapse with loss of £1,000,000

		Cost  

		Timescale (Crossrail!!!)

		Approvers ???

		Stakeholders !!! (give account to)

			Investors 
		
		Cost-Benefit Analysis : How will it benefit our business?

			ROI : Return On Investment  (long term)

			




Advanced Communication

NLP Neuro		First responses ('first mental map'
			ie how you encounter world around you
			5 SENSES : Touch, smell, taste, sight , hear
    Linguistic 
			Learning : how you process information

    Programming		Action : what you DO!  

Bias
	
	tend to take sides based on our personal preference

		OBJECTIVE		FACTUAL, IMPARTIAL, UNBIASED

		SUBJECTIVE		OPINION BASED, CAN CHANGE

	Exam : cases which may cause bias

		Pressure of time : people tend not to think things through 
					carefully

		Money : lack of it : tends to cause pressured behaviour

		Lack of information / meaning / clarity : Poor decisions based
				on half-information
		
		Diversity issues

		Overwhelmed with choice : too much info!

		(human level) forget which can limit ability to make good 
				decisions (limitations of memory)

	Examples

		Anchoring bias : tend to choose 'first option'

		Choice-supportive : support option which you personally prefer				
		Confirmation bias : I've already reached my conclusion so
			the facts must fit my choice.

		Outcome bias : concerned about the consequences of a certain
				outcome rather than making a good, rational
				decision

	Reducing Bias

		6 'objective hats'   (De Bono Thinking Hats)

		White		pure facts only
		Yellow		optimistic choice
		Black		pessimist / negatives / dangers
		Red		emotional / feelings to do with this decision
		Green		creativity, creating opportunities from 				nothing
		Blue		rational decision

	== pause overnight ==


	For..each loop

	Treehouse

	Create github account online 
		create new repository 'repo'

Programming Puzzle : Fizz-Buzz

	Count to 100

		If divisible by 3 ==> Print 'fizz'

		                5           'buzz'

				3 and 5     'fizzbuzz'

		Otherwise just print the number


		1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz

		divisible????

			/                        10/3  3.333
			% remainder (modulus)    10%3 = 10 divide by 3 and what is the remainder???  ==> 1

						 i%3 = 0  on 3,6,9
						 i%5 = 0  on 5,10,15

		Equals

			a=6    assigning 6 to a

			if(a==6)    does a equal 6???

	lots         few                         5 max               

Time Management 

	Boxing : limit time on task, helps not to just run without end

	2 mins : just do it!

	1	Capture
	2	Organise
			Prioritise
	3. 	Do
			Plan , Track progress, Report

# C# #

Structure of an application

.sln
	Solution
		Container object : of itself it does nothing
		XML : lists projects and other 'meta' data

	Project

		.csproj
			XML with details of project

		ONE PROJECT : COMPILE TO BINARY FILES (NON-HUMAN-READABLE)
				1) .exe  running application 
				2) .dll  library (dynamic link library)  

Referencing files

	From one project to another, we can 'use' or 'reference' files (normally we call them 'classes') from one project in another project.

	Lab
		1) Build lab_04.dll and exposed a PUBLIC CLASS WITH A PUBLIC FIELD

		2) Build lab_05_using_dll.exe which reads from lab_04.dll

			((Add a reference to achieve this))


CSC C Sharp Compiler

To 'compile' is to take code from readable .cs to .exe running code

	compile = repackage our code in such a way that it can be processed by the CPU as 
			running code, and run as an application/library on the computer

	.NET has several languages and they can all compile to same code

							==>      'half-way-house'                   ==>        Runtime			

		C++
		C#
		VB Visual Basic			     CIL COMMON INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE             'CLR'
		F#																		Common language
																				Runtime (matched to CPU
																				architecture)

		Exercise : view and inspect CIL compiled code

			TOOL : ILDASM  (Visual Studio Command Line 'Developer Tools')


		.cs raw human-readable code

			CIL half-way-house compiled code

				CLR runtime 


.CSC compiling a single file

	The C Sharp compiler can compile just one file, without Visual Studio

	Copy program.cs to notepad and save as myapp.cs

		Compile c:\......\csc.exe  myapp.cs

			==> create myapp.exe  


.NET vs .NET Core

Windows computers are built with a programming language called 'C'.  This has developed into modern C++.  ((Linux/Apple/Android/Windows all have 'C' at heart))

	Raw, fast ==> C++ best option

	But!!!  Visual Basic (old) and C# have both been created with developer in mind, for ease 
			of coding

			Java (non-microsoft)
			VB
			C#
						High level languages ==> slower but a lot of features, easy to use !

	Windows ==> over time, huge 'library' of code built by Microsoft

		.NET library

			using System.IO;    part of .NET

				Too big!!! (4.2GB) and Windows-only

	.NET Core => cut-down version for all operating systems
	
	Both are now OPEN SOURCE!!!

		CLOSED SOURCE ==> WINDOWS10,APPLE  (only the company can work on this code)
		OPEN SOURCE ==> ANYONE CAN CONTRIBUTE


Namespace

	Useful for creating a 'container' for our code

		In each container we can have unique names, so there is no risk of conflict



using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using phil1;

namespace lab_06_namespace
{

    public class GreatTrainer { }
}

namespace phil2 {
    public class ExcellentLearning {
        public string LearnLots = "running C#";
    }
}




	

	Main() method	


		Start point for every program

	Program types

		Console EXE
		Library  DLL
		Old - Windows Forms
		New - WPF Forms
		Xamarin - Mobile Apps (Android, IOS)
		Unity - Games
		UWP Universal Windows Platform : Windows 10 'Store' apps 


Args array

	When we run a program the Main() method gives us access to the 'Args' array


	If we run any program eg myapp.exe some data here then the extra words are treated
			as input for the program 


            Console.WriteLine("Printing out arguments array");
           
            if(args.Length == 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("There are no arguments");
            }
            else
            {
                foreach (string item in args)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Your item is - " + item);

## Simple Programming

Covered last week, in passing!

Loops

	4 types

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace lab_08_loops

            }

        }
    }
}

```


## Operators

We can use `operators` to do things, like addition, subtraction etc

### Increment operators

```CS
// increment operators - adding one!
int x = 100;
//  y=x  then x++ ie increment x by 1
// so y=x=100 then x increments to 101
int y = x++;  // same as int x=100; y=x; x++;
// think answer is :     101         100
// actual answer is :    
Console.WriteLine($"x is {x} and y is {y}");

// if we want expected results use this
int a = 100;
int b = ++a;
// BOTH 101 AS EXPECTED
// firstly increment a to 101 then b=a=101 after
Console.WriteLine($"a is {a} and b is {b}");

// GENERAL RULE = JUST ONLY USE ++; ON IT'S OWN SEPARATE LINE!!!

// best way

int r = 1000;
r++;          // UP TO 1001
int s = r;  // clear and no nonsense!!!  BOTH 1001

```

X-- is decrement operator


### NOT OPERATOR

```cs
//  !true=false

bool isExcellent = true;
bool isRubbish = false;

Console.WriteLine(isExcellent);   // TRUE
Console.WriteLine(!isExcellent);  // FALSE

```

### Bodmas / Bidmas

Brackets
Indices
Divide/Multiply
Add/Subtract


// Got to get your BIDMAS clear!!!

// 96 + 20 / 5 - 77 / 11

//  96  +  4    -     7

//  93

// WRITE OUT ON COMPUTER AND GET ANSWER

//  5 SQUARED * 13 CUBED - 7 / 4

```CS


Console.WriteLine(5*5*13*13*13-(7/4.0));

var FiveSquared = Math.Pow(5, 2);
var ThirteenCubed = Math.Pow(13, 3);

Console.WriteLine(FiveSquared*ThirteenCubed-(7/4.0));


Console.WriteLine(Math.Sqrt(100));

// modulus

Console.WriteLine(100/8); // 12 WRONG - CARE!! integers yield integers!!!
Console.WriteLine(100/8.0);  // 12.5 CORRECT
Console.WriteLine(100%8); // 4 REMAINDER CORRECT



```



## Data Types 

Let's look at the following

Strings

Integers : short, int and long

Unsigned integers : uint

Floats

Doubles

Decimal

null


```CS
// string
string x = "hi";
String y = " there";
// use lowercase 'string'
// uppercase String is when use String as a 'class'

// concatenate
Console.WriteLine(x+y);
//  super-long strings this is MEMORY INEFFICIENT
// stringbuilder : use to build very long strings
var longString = new StringBuilder();
for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
{
    longString.Append($"adding{i}");
}
// Console.WriteLine(longString);

// Integers ARE 32 BITS LONG!!!
int anyNumber = 23456;
Console.WriteLine(anyNumber.GetType());

```

Using computers to store data

All computers store data like this

	var number = 1010;      raw data is stored as 0 or 1 (bit)

	If our number had 4 bits then in binary we can count from

		0       0000
		1       0001
		2       0010
		3       0011
        4       0100
        ..
        15      1111

        With 4 bits we can count from 0 to 15 (16 spaces ie 2 to power 4 = 16)


        Now let's take a number with 32 bits - what is the maximum???

        	2^32 = ????  4 billion

        			4 294 967 296

        short = 16 bits (2^16 = 65536)

        long = 64 bits (2^64 = 1.8446744e+19)


        Only thing to be aware of is that we also have to store a +/- sign for every number
        	because -200000 or +200000 

        Therefore ONE BIT IS FOR 'SIGN' 

        	INT : 32 BITS : ACTUALLY HAS ONLY 31 BITS FOR NUMBER AND 1 BIT FOR SIGN

        	Prove : Int.MaxValue()
        	        Int.MinValue()
