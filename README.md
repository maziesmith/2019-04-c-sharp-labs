Communication : Email

Business Email

Hi

I’m enquiring about possible courses in C# with Sparta.

My background is Civil Engineering and I have recently graduated with a 2:2 from Brunel University last year.

I enclose my CV and look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you

Philip Anderson





Friendly email


Hi 

Great to see you in class yesterday; hope things went well.

How did the Treehouse go?

Thanks

Phil

??



Send 2 emails


1.	Friendly asking for something

2.	Business : manager : time off




Whatsapp

	Great for quick, instant communication, team spirit 


Microsoft Teams

	Chat : Business app : keep spelling and grammar good; otherwise no particular rules

	Group Chat: professional environment 



Managing emails

	Inbox 			==> actionble email (ie something to do or reply)

		> Topic1

		> Topic2

		> Topic3

		> Archive 

		Trash


	Good practice : daily go through emails and try and ignore them while you want to do 'useful work'

		((Batch replies : until you've finished your 'useful work' for the day))

		Study time : 

			'Go dark' and not reply to ANY EMAILS until 3pm 

			Bad : study day : 9am reply to email ==> a) ask to do work
							         b) distraction (trivia)
								 c) disturb YOUR FOCUS

		Try not to let email 'rule your life' by 'always-on', must-instant-reply !!!


	THINK ABOUT !!!

		INBOX ZERO : keep inbox clear!!!

		?? Work from oldest emails up ??




Use of English

	
	Grammar : learn how to use English grammar correctly 

	Spelling : learn and increase your learning !  


Delicate or sensitive matters

	Write once, not send then reread carefully either straight away or, better, after a pause.



Time Management

	Under-promise, over-deliver

	Always assume things will take longer than you might initially plan

	Big task

		Break down : Prioritise


		Eisenhower Model

						Urgent			

			Important		Necessity (fighting fires!)			(High) Quality 
												(life-enhancing
												work lives here)


						Urgent, Not important				Not important
						(Deception) - time wasters			Not urgent
												(Waste) of time!

			

	Pareto Principle

		20% of effort can produce 80% of desired results

	Time Boxing

		Putting a time limit on task : psychologically can trigger more effective work



	Task management 

		If it takes less than 2 minutes, DO IT!!!


		To Do Lists!!!


			1. Capture Tasks : phone calls, emails, chat etc ==> INTO ONE PLACE!!!

			2. Organise : Prioritise Tasks and Your Day

				Calendar : (Google calendar ==> alerts & emails!!!)

				Daily : Write out tasks for day  (night before or first thing)

			3  Do IT!!!!

				In order !!!

				Projects

					1) Plan well

					2) Track progress

					3) Report on progress



	Exam : Time Management main points/categories

		1) Timeboxing
		2) Measuring/Recording tasks and progress
		3) Effective Meetings (at work)

			Developers : Daily 'stand-up'  (10-15 min max total time)

					Everyone : What you did (yesterday), Doing (today), Blocker/hindrances

			Planned meeting : invite people carefully, agenda, minutes, report on outcomes and actions
			




Progress At The Academy

	Coding

		Functionality : Does code work???

		Readability : does code read well visually? appropriate comments?

		Reuse/Maintain

			DRY Don't Repeat Yourself!

				Loop 1 to 100

				Loop 1 to 1000


				or (better)				

				Loop(1 to max)

		2. Outline
		3. Topics
			
					Report vs Powerpoint
			
						Report : rule of 5 : Intro, Backgound to topic, 
							Transition into details, Fine detail, conclusion

						Powerpoint : rule of 3 : 3 sections/slides per topic

	KISS : Keep It Simple, Stupid!!!

	Tips for newbies

		Bottle of water : 'pause time' 

		Humour!
	


Project Management

	BAU Business As Usual		Regular run-of-mill-work

	Projects

		Unique
		Transient
					Inserted into workplace with definite goal
		
		Clear aim

			Phases

			Specialists

			Involve complexity

	Constraints on a project

		1) Balance 		TIME       vs         QUALITY           vs       COST


	POPIT IT Model

					people

			  		IT
			
			processes		 organisation
			(flow of work)            (company)






		

IT Projects : Examples of SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle

	Waterfall : simple, fixed projects

		First IT projects like this
		Fixed, unchanging : List of Requirements, Analyse, Design, Build, Test, Release	
		Good for manufacturing / military / small projects	
		
		V-model
			Waterfall + Extra Testing for mission-critical projects

	Agile : changing projects

		Check ' Agile Manifesto '
		
		IT : spectacular fails!!!  Design : too big + whole project : takes too long!!!	

		Solution : Don't design project fully in intricate detail up front.  Only design
			first simple prototype (( MVP Minimum Viable Product ))  (Sprint 1)
			Then => Sprint 2 : Add an INCREMENT OF FUNCTIONALITY!!!
			Sprint 3 : Next iteration etc
		
		Scrum : work in short increments (sprints)

			3-9 developers
			Daily 'stand up'
			Sprint is a focused piece of work

	Kanban : continuous flow

		Car manufacturing is 24/7

		Some industries better with 'flow' of work non-stop.

			Kanban 'board' list of tasks but limit 'number of tasks in progress at any
				one time'


	
	Proposing a new project

		Risk

			% chance that something will go wrong

				% Probability 'x' which will result in loss of impact 'y'

				20% chance market will collapse with loss of £1,000,000

		Cost  

		Timescale (Crossrail!!!)

		Approvers ???

		Stakeholders !!! (give account to)

			Investors 
		
		Cost-Benefit Analysis : How will it benefit our business?

			ROI : Return On Investment  (long term)

			




Advanced Communication

NLP Neuro		First responses ('first mental map'
			ie how you encounter world around you
			5 SENSES : Touch, smell, taste, sight , hear
    Linguistic 
			Learning : how you process information

    Programming		Action : what you DO!  

Bias
	
	tend to take sides based on our personal preference

		OBJECTIVE		FACTUAL, IMPARTIAL, UNBIASED

		SUBJECTIVE		OPINION BASED, CAN CHANGE

	Exam : cases which may cause bias

		Pressure of time : people tend not to think things through 
					carefully

		Money : lack of it : tends to cause pressured behaviour

		Lack of information / meaning / clarity : Poor decisions based
				on half-information
		
		Diversity issues

		Overwhelmed with choice : too much info!

		(human level) forget which can limit ability to make good 
				decisions (limitations of memory)

	Examples

		Anchoring bias : tend to choose 'first option'

		Choice-supportive : support option which you personally prefer				
		Confirmation bias : I've already reached my conclusion so
			the facts must fit my choice.

		Outcome bias : concerned about the consequences of a certain
				outcome rather than making a good, rational
				decision

	Reducing Bias

		6 'objective hats'   (De Bono Thinking Hats)

		White		pure facts only
		Yellow		optimistic choice
		Black		pessimist / negatives / dangers
		Red		emotional / feelings to do with this decision
		Green		creativity, creating opportunities from 				nothing
		Blue		rational decision

	== pause overnight ==


	For..each loop

	Treehouse

	Create github account online

Programming Puzzle : Fizz-Buzz

	Count to 100

		If divisible by 3 ==> Print 'fizz'

		                5           'buzz'

				3 and 5     'fizzbuzz'

		Otherwise just print the number


		1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz

		divisible????

			/                        10/3  3.333
			% remainder (modulus)    10%3 = 10 divide by 3 and what is the remainder???  ==> 1

						 i%3 = 0  on 3,6,9
						 i%5 = 0  on 5,10,15

		Equals

			a=6    assigning 6 to a

			if(a==6)    does a equal 6???

	2 mins : just do it!

	1	Capture
	2	Organise
			Prioritise

# C# #

Structure of an application

.sln
	Solution
		Container object : of itself it does nothing
		XML : lists projects and other 'meta' data
 
	Project

		.csproj
			XML with details of project

		ONE PROJECT : COMPILE TO BINARY FILES (NON-HUMAN-READABLE)
				1) .exe  running application 
				2) .dll  library (dynamic link library)  

Referencing files

	From one project to another, we can 'use' or 'reference' files (normally we call them 'classes') from one project in another project.

	Lab
		1) Build lab_04.dll and exposed a PUBLIC CLASS WITH A PUBLIC FIELD

		2) Build lab_05_using_dll.exe which reads from lab_04.dll

			((Add a reference to achieve this))


CSC C Sharp Compiler

To 'compile' is to take code from readable .cs to .exe running code

	compile = repackage our code in such a way that it can be processed by the CPU as 
			running code, and run as an application/library on the computer

	.NET has several languages and they can all compile to same code

							==>      'half-way-house'                   ==>        Runtime			

		C++
		C#
		VB Visual Basic			     CIL COMMON INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE             'CLR'
		F#																		Common language
																				Runtime (matched to CPU
																				architecture)

		Exercise : view and inspect CIL compiled code

			TOOL : ILDASM  (Visual Studio Command Line 'Developer Tools')


		.cs raw human-readable code

			CIL half-way-house compiled code

				CLR runtime 


.CSC compiling a single file

	The C Sharp compiler can compile just one file, without Visual Studio

	Copy program.cs to notepad and save as myapp.cs

		Compile c:\......\csc.exe  myapp.cs

			==> create myapp.exe  


.NET vs .NET Core

Windows computers are built with a programming language called 'C'.  This has developed into modern C++.  ((Linux/Apple/Android/Windows all have 'C' at heart))

	Raw, fast ==> C++ best option

	But!!!  Visual Basic (old) and C# have both been created with developer in mind, for ease 
			of coding

			Java (non-microsoft)
			VB
			C#
						High level languages ==> slower but a lot of features, easy to use !

	Windows ==> over time, huge 'library' of code built by Microsoft

		.NET library

			using System.IO;    part of .NET

				Too big!!! (4.2GB) and Windows-only

	.NET Core => cut-down version for all operating systems
	
	Both are now OPEN SOURCE!!!

		CLOSED SOURCE ==> WINDOWS10,APPLE  (only the company can work on this code)
		OPEN SOURCE ==> ANYONE CAN CONTRIBUTE


Namespace

	Useful for creating a 'container' for our code

		In each container we can have unique names, so there is no risk of conflict



using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using phil1;

namespace lab_06_namespace
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var item = new phil1.GreatTrainer();
            // add using statement, can see directly

    public class GreatTrainer { }
}

namespace phil2 {
    public class ExcellentLearning {
        public string LearnLots = "running C#";
    }
}




	

	Main() method	


		Start point for every program

	Program types

		Console EXE
		Library  DLL
		Old - Windows Forms
		New - WPF Forms
		Xamarin - Mobile Apps (Android, IOS)
		Unity - Games
		UWP Universal Windows Platform : Windows 10 'Store' apps 


Args array

	When we run a program the Main() method gives us access to the 'Args' array


	If we run any program eg myapp.exe some data here then the extra words are treated
			as input for the program 


            Console.WriteLine("Printing out arguments array");
           
            if(args.Length == 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("There are no arguments");
            }
            else
            {
                foreach (string item in args)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Your item is - " + item);

## Simple Programming

Covered last week, in passing!

Loops

	4 types

```csharp
using System;

            // LAST ITEM : INDEX = SIZE-1  IE 10-1 = [9]
            myIntegerArray[9] = 999;

            // FOREACH : COUNT OVER EVERY ITEM IN ARRAY
            foreach(int item in myIntegerArray)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Item in array is {item}");
            }

            // REPEAT FOR A STRING ARRAY
            string[] myArray  = new string[3];
            // FILL ARRAY AT SAME TIME : STRING 'LITERALS' GOING IN CODE
            string[] myArray2 = new string[]{ "one", "two", "three" };
            // fill the array 
            myArray[0] = "one";
            myArray[1] = "two";
            myArray[2] = "three";
            // foreach loop to print the items
            // PRINT myArray
            foreach(string item in myArray)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }
            foreach(string item in myArray2){
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }
            // NOTE CAN USE FOR - start at 0 and count to the array length - 1 
            for(int i = 0;i < myArray2.Length; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Using for loop over array - {myArray2[i]}");
            }

            // 10-MINUTE LAB : BUILD FOR LOOP, THEN ALSO BUILD A WHILE LOOP.
            // BOTH WILL COUNT TO 1000 (step 50)
            for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i+=50)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"for loop to 1000 - {i}");
            }

            counter = 0;
            while (counter < 1000)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"While loop to 1000 - {counter}");
                counter+=50;
            }
            // BONUS : FILL ARRAY WITH 1000 NUMBERS AND PRINT OUT ALSO
            // VAR JUST MEANS 'any variable type' - let the computer decide
            // (ALREADY STATED TYPE ON RIGHT IE int[1000]
            var myLargeArray = new int[1000];
            for (int i = 0; i < myLargeArray.Length; i++)
            {
                // fill the array
                myLargeArray[i] = i;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < myLargeArray.Length; i++)
            {
                // print the items
                myLargeArray[i] = i;
            }

        }
    }
}

```


## Operators

We can use `operators` to do things, like addition, subtraction etc

### Increment operators

```CS
// increment operators - adding one!
int x = 100;
//  y=x  then x++ ie increment x by 1
// so y=x=100 then x increments to 101
int y = x++;  // same as int x=100; y=x; x++;
// think answer is :     101         100
// actual answer is :    
Console.WriteLine($"x is {x} and y is {y}");

// if we want expected results use this
int a = 100;
int b = ++a;
// BOTH 101 AS EXPECTED
// firstly increment a to 101 then b=a=101 after
Console.WriteLine($"a is {a} and b is {b}");

// GENERAL RULE = JUST ONLY USE ++; ON IT'S OWN SEPARATE LINE!!!

// best way

int r = 1000;
r++;          // UP TO 1001
int s = r;  // clear and no nonsense!!!  BOTH 1001

```

X-- is decrement operator


### NOT OPERATOR

```cs
//  !true=false

bool isExcellent = true;
bool isRubbish = false;

Console.WriteLine(isExcellent);   // TRUE
Console.WriteLine(!isExcellent);  // FALSE

```

### Bodmas / Bidmas

Brackets
Indices
Divide/Multiply
Add/Subtract


// Got to get your BIDMAS clear!!!

// 96 + 20 / 5 - 77 / 11

//  96  +  4    -     7

//  93

// WRITE OUT ON COMPUTER AND GET ANSWER

//  5 SQUARED * 13 CUBED - 7 / 4

```CS


Console.WriteLine(5*5*13*13*13-(7/4.0));

var FiveSquared = Math.Pow(5, 2);
var ThirteenCubed = Math.Pow(13, 3);

Console.WriteLine(FiveSquared*ThirteenCubed-(7/4.0));


Console.WriteLine(Math.Sqrt(100));

// modulus

Console.WriteLine(100/8); // 12 WRONG - CARE!! integers yield integers!!!
Console.WriteLine(100/8.0);  // 12.5 CORRECT
Console.WriteLine(100%8); // 4 REMAINDER CORRECT



```



## Data Types 

Let's look at the following

Strings

Integers : short, int and long

Unsigned integers : uint

Floats

Doubles

Decimal

null


```CS
// string
string x = "hi";
String y = " there";
// use lowercase 'string'
// uppercase String is when use String as a 'class'

// concatenate
Console.WriteLine(x+y);
//  super-long strings this is MEMORY INEFFICIENT
// stringbuilder : use to build very long strings
var longString = new StringBuilder();
for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
{
    longString.Append($"adding{i}");
}
// Console.WriteLine(longString);

// Integers ARE 32 BITS LONG!!!
int anyNumber = 23456;
Console.WriteLine(anyNumber.GetType());

```

Using computers to store data

All computers store data like this

	var number = 1010;      raw data is stored as 0 or 1 (bit)

	If our number had 4 bits then in binary we can count from

		0       0000
		1       0001
		2       0010
		3       0011
        4       0100
        ..
        15      1111

        With 4 bits we can count from 0 to 15 (16 spaces ie 2 to power 4 = 16)


        Now let's take a number with 32 bits - what is the maximum???

        	2^32 = ????  4 billion

        			4 294 967 296

        short = 16 bits (2^16 = 65536)

        long = 64 bits (2^64 = 1.8446744e+19)


        Only thing to be aware of is that we also have to store a +/- sign for every number
        	because -200000 or +200000 

        Therefore ONE BIT IS FOR 'SIGN' 

        	INT : 32 BITS : ACTUALLY HAS ONLY 31 BITS FOR NUMBER AND 1 BIT FOR SIGN

        	Prove : Int.MaxValue()
        	        Int.MinValue()

```

Compile : turn .cs code into .exe binary or .dll binary

.NET : Can use multiple languages C# C++ which all compile to CIL intermediate language

.NET CORE : websites

Main() method has string[] array called 'args'

	myapp 1 2 3   sends 1 2 3 as 'arguments'


Debugging

	How to stop a program and inspect the variables???

	Set a breakpoint!!!  

	F5 to start

	F10 or F11 to continue stepping through program

	Conditional debug : only break if a certain condition is met !!!!

	Watching a variable 

		Right click and watch

	Autos : very useful : just shows all of variables in use ON THIS LINE OR PREVIOUS LINE  (Variables in 'scope')


Running an application in 'debug' mode or 'release' mode

	DEBUG ==> SLOWER

	RELEASE ==> PRODUCTION ie debug tools turned off


		SET THIS IN  BUILD=>CONFIGURATION MANAGER => DEBUG/RELEASE

				((Similar to 'minification' in Javascript world  .min.js faster))

		F5 => DEBUG

		CONTROL + F5 ==> RELEASE



WPF application demo

	Current app in Windows 

		WPF = WINDOWS PRESENTATION FOUNDATION

	WPF uses XML for graphic interface

	<window ...>  main graphics  .xaml     eXtensible Application Markup Language

		.cs  'code-behind'    ie 2 files (XML and .cs)  for every page		




Rounding Errors In Computing

	Computers cannot store decimal numbers accurately


		eg 10.1 cannot be stored 100% accurately on a computer

				Computers think in powers of 1,2,4,8, 16 etc and decimal is an 'alien'
				numbering structure

	Worked example to illustrate this

```cs
double total = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 8192; i++)
{
    total += 0.7;
}
Console.WriteLine(total);

// after 8000 loops, 9 decimal places is enough
// for us to lose accuracy++++++


decimal total2 = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 8192; i++)
{
    total2 += 0.7M;
}
Console.WriteLine(total2);

```	

Other data types

null

```cs
string x = null;
string y = "";
Console.WriteLine(x == y);  // false

// If reading from database and there
// literally is no data coming in,
// then that's a 'null'

// integers : default value is '0'
int z = new int();
Console.WriteLine(z);

// Scenario : reading numbers from database
// Want to differentiate from '0' and blank space

// nullable integer
int? zz = 0;
zz = null;
```


DateTime

```cs

// declare date
// not very helpful : default date is 1 Jan 0001 at midnight
var d = new DateTime();


Console.WriteLine(d);

var e = DateTime.Today;   // midnight 
var f = DateTime.Now;     // now


Console.WriteLine(e);
Console.WriteLine(f);

// add calendar day/week/month
e = e.AddDays(1);
e = e.AddMonths(1);
e = e.AddHours(1);

Console.WriteLine(e);

// elapsed time
// use seconds, milliseconds, ticks (10-7 seconds ie 100 nanoseconds!)

// CRUDE : SUBTRACTING TIME
var start = DateTime.Now;

int total = 0;

for(int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++)
{
    total += i;
}

Console.WriteLine(total);

var stop = DateTime.Now;

Console.WriteLine($"Counting took {(stop - start)}");
Console.WriteLine($"Counting took {(stop - start).Milliseconds}");
Console.WriteLine($"Counting took {(stop - start).Ticks}");


// EASY WAY : CREATE 'STOPWATCH'

var s = new Stopwatch();
s.Start();

total = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++)
{
    total += i;
}

s.Stop();
Console.WriteLine(s.ElapsedTicks);
Console.WriteLine(s.Elapsed);
```



### bytes

Bytes are important 

	raw data is stored in bits = 1 or 0

	bytes are blocks of 8 bits   10101010

		bytes can have min value 0 (00000000) and max value 255 which is all 1's (11111111)

	nibble are blocks of 4 bits 1010  with min 0 (0000) and max 15 (1111)

				                             HEX  0.9     A=10,B=11,C=12,D=13,E=14,F=15	
```cs

            byte b = 0b10101010; // latest c# has literal binary type

            // also use hex

            byte bb = 0xFF;   // f=15 decimal = 1111 binary
                              //   FF = 11111111 in binary

            byte bbb = 15;

```


Bytes become useful with	a) Encryption
	b) Sending data : STREAMING : data is sent in chunks of BYTES

			byte[] array of bytes to send raw data


 
Char

	ASCII is a numbering system for basic characters

	Each 'character' has a related number and we call this  a 'char' data type

```cs
char c = 'f';
Console.WriteLine(c);
// convert to a number using (int) (casting)
Console.WriteLine((int)c);

char c02 = 'g';
Console.WriteLine(c02);
// convert to a number using (int) (casting)
Console.WriteLine((int)c02);

// Convert a number to a character
char c03 = (char)104;
Console.WriteLine(c03);
```	

Char is useful to parse strings character by character

```cs
string s = "abcdef";
foreach (char item in s)
{
    Console.WriteLine(item);
}
```


Encoding!

ASCII counts from 0 to 127

Web : count from 0 to 255 and call this UTF8  (internet, default way write text)

C#  : uses the upgrade to this called UNICODE OR UTF16 and this means 16 bits for every character 
	used.  Reason we use this ==> allows for Chinese and other non-english characters



### raw object data type

In most computing languages 'object' is the parent of all other data types

```CS
// raw objects

object o1 = 10;
o1 = "hi";
Console.WriteLine(o1);
object o2 = "hi";
object o3 = false;

// custom
// key/value pairs
object o4 = new
{
    name = "Bob",
    dob = "20/3/2000"
};


// BAD BAD CODING BUT JUST FOR ILLUSTRATION!!!
dynamic o5 = 12;
o5 = "hi";
o5 = false;


// const

const string DONT_CHANGE_ME = "I don't change";
// DontChangeMe = "to something else";

```


### Casting

C# is 'strongly typed' so int, double are 'different'

2 ==> 2.0      IMPLICIT (= SAFE) CASTING

2.3 ==> 2  (LOSE DATA)     EXPLICIT (=DANGEROUS) CASTING 

	CASTING

```cs
// SAFE CASTING

int i = 10;
double d = i;


// EXPLICIT (DANGEROUS) CASTING
double dd = 10.79;
int ii = (int)dd;
Console.WriteLine(ii);

// different to rounding

Console.WriteLine(Math.Round(dd));
Console.WriteLine(Math.Floor(dd));
Console.WriteLine(Math.Ceiling(dd));
```


BOXING

```cs

// boxing is same as casting but to object

int iii = 100;
object ooo = iii;

// unbox

int jjj = (int)ooo;

```




AND/OR/XOR

Truth table

AND OPERATOR 

										 OUTPUT    : ARE THEY BOTH ON?  (AND)      

	INPUT    1     1                     							HIGH (TRUE OR 1)
            high  high


             0     0												LOW (FALSE OR  0)
             low   low 


             1     0												0

             0     1												0



OR OPERATOR

			INPUT    		OUTPUT (ARE EITHER OF THEM HIGH)
			1 1 						1
			0 0 						0
			1 0 						1
			0 1 						1


// ^ XOR

// SAME AS OR BUT FALSE IF BOTH HIGH		ARE ONE (AND ONLY ONE) OF THEM HIGH?	

		1 1      0
		1 0      1
		0 1      1
		0 0      0

		1^1     RETURN FALSE
		1^0            TRUE











### OOP Object Oriented Programming

Intro to OOP!!!

What is OOP??

### Scripting

Historically computing was created with 'batch files' which run 'top-down' ie start at line 1 and run to close

### .bat

Windows 'batch' file

run with myScript.bat

also .cmd works as well

### .ps1

Same thing but with  more powerful scripts

Remember : must allow Powershell scripts with 'Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted'

Run file with ./myScript.ps1

### Linux computer 'BASH' shell does similar work


### OOP 

With GUI (Graphic User Interface) all of a sudden users interact with screen 'objects' eg button, inputs etc

Screen 'object' and user 'event' eg click, double-click, hover, keypress, select etc

New style of coding where no longer 'top-down' scripting but code attached to indiviual objects or events.

Much simpler to maintain as code is naturally 'modular' and tied to objects/events.

Javascript 'onclick' handler and 'click' event

	Button addEventListener('click', function(){ // do some stuff })

CSharp in 'WPF' graphic app we similar structure

	Button_01_Click(object sender, eventArgs e){  // do stuff here }

		'sender' object would be our button
		eventArgs 'e' would contain ARRAY OF STRINGS PASSED FROM BUTTON TO OUR EVENT HANDLER CODE (METHOD)

How do we create objects in C#?

	Manually ==> Object o = new {  name="fred",age=21 }

But say we have 1000 cars in a factory : we want to be able to create 1000 'car objects' with fixed structure - how do we create our 'template' for a new car?

    car01 = { weight:1000, length:2000, width:1500, color:"red" }


The template we use is called a 'Class'

	Class Car {


	}


The reason we use classes is similar to nature

In nature we have 'genus' or 'species' = 'class' of animal or plant

mammal

		cat
				lion
						american lion
						asiatic lion

				tiger


				cheetah



		dog


reptile


car
	mercedes
			a-class
					A180D
							sport
					A35


Let's create some code ...

```cs
    class Parent
    {
        public string Name;
        public int Age;
        public double Height;
    }
```

We think of 'class' as 'blueprint' for new objects

When we create a building the 'blueprint' is the master drawing.  Builders would then create real building from our blueprint

Computing : blueprint ==> 'class'
	
	From class ==> create 'real' object (real Parent)  ==>  INSTANTIATION



```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace lab_24_inheritance
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var p01 = new Parent();
            p01.Name = "Father";
            var c01 = new Child();
            c01.Name = "Child";
            // give age
            c01.Age = 12;
            // make grow in loop : 10 times
            c01.Grow();
            c01.Grow();
            Console.WriteLine(c01.GrowReturningAge());  //increase age, print new age
            Console.WriteLine(c01.GrowReturningAge());
            Console.WriteLine(c01.GrowReturningAge());
            var newAge = c01.GrowReturningAge();
            newAge = c01.GrowReturningAge();
        }
    }

    class Parent {
        public string Name;
        public int Age;
        // age
        public void Grow() {
            Age++;
        }
        // grow
        public int GrowReturningAge()
        {
            Age++;
            return Age;
        }
    }

    class Child : Parent { }
}


```

## Methods

```cs
            // void method

// return int
int ReturnNumber()
{
    return 12;
}

// return string
string ReturnText()
{
    return "some text";
}

// CALL THE METHODS
ReturnNumber();    // WASTING THE OUTPUT; NOT USING IT!!!
ReturnText();
// use the output
var output1 = ReturnNumber();
var output2 = ReturnText();
// print outputs
Console.WriteLine($"output 1 is {output1} and output 2 is {output2}");
Console.WriteLine($"output 1 is {ReturnNumber()} and output 2 is {ReturnText()}");


// PASS IN INPUT ALSO INTO A METHOD
void PrintNumber(int myNumber)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Your number is {myNumber}");
}

PrintNumber(10);
PrintNumber(100);
PrintNumber(1000);


// send in data and get data back
double Cube(int myNumber)
{
    return Math.Pow(myNumber, 3);
}

Console.WriteLine(Cube(10));
Console.WriteLine(Cube(11));
Console.WriteLine(Cube(12));

```



	
## Finish off day with some more simple coding

### if..else if .. else

  int x = 100;

  if (x == 10){ .. }
  else if (x == 20) { }
  else {   }

### Ternary operator

  (Test a condition : is it true or false?) ? if true do this
  			:  if false do this ;




















## Random Notes And Topics
Main()  ==> Method ==> START POINT OF EVERY PROGRAM

	Class Program {  static void Main(){  
			// PROGRAM STARTS HERE!!!! 
		}
   }

public ==> exposes code to be visible publicly (by all code)


























# Tuesday : Review

Class is a blueprint to create objects
Class Parent{}
Class Child : Parent{}
Class MyClass{
	public int Field01;       
	public string Field02;    // fields
	private bool _ isEnabled;   // normally private ofen with _ prefix
	public int Property01 {get; set;}   // property 
}








## List<T> 

List<int>
List<string>
List<AnyType>
T = Type : Generics  (Generic item is a general item)
using System.Collections.Generic;  is required
List has an INDEX LIKE ARRAY [0] first item, [1] second item etc
	So for this reason we can use any methods which are valid over arrays
	including List01.ForEach() method

	Note : Arrow notation (Lambda) is used often to replace a longer method

List.Add(item)  (end)
List.Insert(item,index)
List.RemoveAt..
               0 1 2 3 4
               insert new item at index 2 : push others along 
               0 1  (new item at 2)  3 4 5
foreach(var item in MyList){
	cw(item)   in numeric order of index ie 0 1 2 3 etc
}
Unlike array, can extend.
.Concat() method 
Yes it is possible to do List<List<int>>


```cs
        static List<int> list01 = new List<int>();
        List<string> list02 = new List<string>();

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            list01.Add(10);
            list01.Add(20);
            foreach (var item in list01) {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }
        }
```

## Stacks

Stack<int>
Stack<string>

Stacks are useful actually inside real computers 

			z=30
		DoThat()
			y=10
			x=20;
		DoThis();
		Main();
		==========STACK MEMORY==============

We call this a LIFO structure : Last in - First out and the picture is that of either a pack of cards or a rugby scrum.

Methods : Push() and Pop()
		Push : add to top
		Pop  : remove from top
		Contains : searches (quite slow) through stack one item at a time : output
				is boolean if a match is found
		Peek : inspect top item without removal


## Summary so far

	List : good thing is that we can extend and it has an index

	Stack : similar to real computer - how it actually runs your programs

	Array : fixed size but easily fastest for Read/Write operations


## Queue

Queue uses FIFO structure : First in first out

	Think  : quiet village where people queue for a bus : first person in queue is also
			first person to get on the bus

			Computing : use this a lot for 1) Batch processing 2) Printing 3) Emails


	Methods : Enqueue(10)   add item
			  Dequeue       remove
			  Contains
			  Peek

   Lab : Write a little lab to queue up 10 integers, check if an item is contained within, peek the first item, and dequeue 3 items then print the queue out with a
   foreach loop




## Review Of Classes with Fields And Properties

field = private
property = public

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace lab_31_classes_with_properties
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var p = new Parent();
            p.SetHidden("hello private data");
            p.Age = 23;
            p.Height = 1500;
            Console.WriteLine(p.Height);
            p.Height = -1500;
            Console.WriteLine(p.Height);
        }
    }

    class Parent {

        private string _hidden;  // private field
        private double height; // private field
        public int Age { get; set; }  // public property : abbreviated form
                                       // auto-implemented properties

        // expanded form

        public double Height
        {
            get
            {
                return height;
            }
            set
            {
                if (value > 0)
                {
                    height = value;  // value is c# code word
                }
            }
        }



        public void SetHidden(string setData)
        {
            _hidden = setData;
        }
        public string GetHidden()
        {
            return _hidden;
        }
    }
}


```


## Methods

`out` keyword
optional parameters
named parameters
static method
instance method
overloading
passing 'by value' and 'by reference'
passing objects into method


There are 3 places we can declare a method

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace lab_32_methods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // 1. in another method (not recommended as gets messy with 'nesting')

            void DoSomething()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hey I am doing something");
            }

            // call it
            DoSomething();

            // call static method
            DoSomethingElse();

 
        }


        // 2. In the same class using STATIC KEYWORD WHICH ATTACHES METHOD TO THIS CLASS
        static void DoSomethingElse()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hey I'm now doing something else");
        }


    }


    // 3. in another class either as STATIC or INSTANCE method

    class Dog
    {
        // instance method
        public void Bark()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("dog is now barking loudly");
        }

        // static field
        public static int NumLegs = 4;



    }

}

```


### Return type

void DoThis(){}
string DoThat(){ return "hi"; }
bool DoNow(){ return true; }


### Parameters

Pass data into method

void DoThis(int x, string y){  // use x, y }

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace lab_33_parameters
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DoThis(10, "hello world");
            var listOutput = BuildAList(100, 200, 300); // using list
            listOutput.ForEach(item => Console.WriteLine(item));
        }

        static void DoThis(int x, string y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(x + " " + y);
        }

        static List<int> BuildAList(int x, int y, int z)
        {
            var list = new List<int>();
            list.Add(x);
            list.Add(y);
            list.Add(z);
            return list;
        }

    }
}


```


### Out parameter for methods

By default, methods only return a single item eg void, int, string

But we can also add `out` parameters as well


```cs
var listOutput = BuildAList(100, 200, 300, out bool isLong); // using list


        static List<int> BuildAList(int x, int y, int z, out bool isLongList)
        {
            var list = new List<int>();
            list.Add(x);
            list.Add(y);
            list.Add(z);
            if (list.Count > 10)
            {
                isLongList = true;
            }
            else
            {
                isLongList = false;
            }
            return list;
```


### Optional parameters

Often we have programs which accept many many parameters but not all of them are required all of the time

If we supply default values then these parameters now become optional

Note that optional parameters always must come after required parameters

```cs
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DoThis(10, "hi", true);
            DoThis(10, "hi");
            DoThat(1, 2, 3, 4);
            DoThat(10,2);
        }

        static void DoThis(int x, string y, bool z = false)
        {

        }

        static void DoThat(int a, int b=5, int c=6, int d=7)
        {

        }

```


### Named Parameters

Named parameters are useful when we have a lot of parameters and don't want to have to remember the order each time.

We just call the method using MyMethod(x:5,y:6,z:7) etc 





### Constructor Methods

In every class we also have a default method called the `constructor`.

This is used to `construct` a new object when we `instantiate` the class

```cs

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var p = new Parent("fred",32);

        }
    }

    class Parent {
        public string Name { get; set; }  //  Property
        public int Age;                   //  Field
        // create a constructor : same name as class
        // this keyword refers to 'instance' ie 'p' above
        public Parent(string name, int age) {
            this.Name = name;
            this.Age = age;
        }
    }
```

Note : constructor is present even when we don't code one.

Default (blank) constructor which is why we use new ... keyword with Class name and brackets

```CS
	var p = new Parent();    // calling CONSTRUCTOR METHOD HERE!
```

But be aware when you code your OWN CONSTRUCTOR, the default (blank) one no longer exists

Be aware for the future that there is also a method called the `destructor` or `finalizer` which can be called when we are destroying an object.  It looks like

  ~MyClass{
  		// code which runs when destroying an object
	}

But!!! C# won't require to use them unless we are dealing with objects outside C# like files, databases, computer memory.

	Actually a cleaner way of using these : using(){} block





### Overloading


Overloading allows us to call the SAME METHOD WITH DIFFERENT PARAMETERS

	DoThis();
	DoThis(10);    
	DoThis(10,20,30);

```cs
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // must instantiate first
            var p = new Parent();
            // can now run INSTANCE METHOD
            p.DoThis();
            p.DoThis(10);
            p.DoThis("hi");
            p.DoThis(10, "hi", true);
            
            // or a STATIC METHOD
            Parent.DoThat();  // same for all instances
            
        }
    }

    class Parent {
        public void DoThis() { Console.WriteLine("no parameters"); }
        public void DoThis(int x) { Console.WriteLine("integer parameter"); }
        public void DoThis(string y) { Console.WriteLine("string parameter"); }
        public void DoThis(int x, string y, bool z) { Console.WriteLine("3 parameters"); }
        public static void DoThat() { Console.WriteLine("static method"); }
    }
```


### Summary
Methods
	optional params
	named params
	constructor methods
	overloading

### Passing integers into a method `by reference`  

	`ref` keyword which allows us to track the integer inside the method

	Normally when we pass an integer into a method it's treated as PRIVATE OR LOCAL INSIDE THE METHOD

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace lab_37_by_reference
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // declare integer
            int x = 1000;
            DoThis(ref x);
            Console.WriteLine($"x in the main method is {x}");
        }

        static void DoThis(ref int x) {
            x = x + 1;
            Console.WriteLine($"x in the method is {x}");
        }
    }
}


```
