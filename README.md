Communication : Email

Business Email

Hi

I’m enquiring about possible courses in C# with Sparta.

My background is Civil Engineering and I have recently graduated with a 2:2 from Brunel University last year.

I enclose my CV and look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you

Philip Anderson





Friendly email


Hi 

Great to see you in class yesterday; hope things went well.

How did the Treehouse go?

Thanks

Phil

??



Send 2 emails


1.	Friendly asking for something

2.	Business : manager : time off




Whatsapp

	Great for quick, instant communication, team spirit 


Microsoft Teams

	Chat : Business app : keep spelling and grammar good; otherwise no particular rules

	Group Chat: professional environment 



Managing emails

	Inbox 			==> actionble email (ie something to do or reply)

		> Topic1

		> Topic2

		> Topic3

		> Archive 

		Trash


	Good practice : daily go through emails and try and ignore them while you want to do 'useful work'

		((Batch replies : until you've finished your 'useful work' for the day))

		Study time : 

			'Go dark' and not reply to ANY EMAILS until 3pm 

			Bad : study day : 9am reply to email ==> a) ask to do work
							         b) distraction (trivia)
								 c) disturb YOUR FOCUS

		Try not to let email 'rule your life' by 'always-on', must-instant-reply !!!


	THINK ABOUT !!!

		INBOX ZERO : keep inbox clear!!!

		?? Work from oldest emails up ??




Use of English

	
	Grammar : learn how to use English grammar correctly 

	Spelling : learn and increase your learning !  


Delicate or sensitive matters

	Write once, not send then reread carefully either straight away or, better, after a pause.



Time Management

	Under-promise, over-deliver

	Always assume things will take longer than you might initially plan

	Big task

		Break down : Prioritise


		Eisenhower Model

						Urgent			

			Important		Necessity (fighting fires!)			(High) Quality 
												(life-enhancing
												work lives here)


						Urgent, Not important				Not important
						(Deception) - time wasters			Not urgent
												(Waste) of time!

			

	Pareto Principle

		20% of effort can produce 80% of desired results

	Time Boxing

		Putting a time limit on task : psychologically can trigger more effective work



	Task management 

		If it takes less than 2 minutes, DO IT!!!


		To Do Lists!!!


			1. Capture Tasks : phone calls, emails, chat etc ==> INTO ONE PLACE!!!

			2. Organise : Prioritise Tasks and Your Day

				Calendar : (Google calendar ==> alerts & emails!!!)

				Daily : Write out tasks for day  (night before or first thing)

			3  Do IT!!!!

				In order !!!

				Projects

					1) Plan well

					2) Track progress

					3) Report on progress



	Exam : Time Management main points/categories

		1) Timeboxing
		2) Measuring/Recording tasks and progress
		3) Effective Meetings (at work)

			Developers : Daily 'stand-up'  (10-15 min max total time)

					Everyone : What you did (yesterday), Doing (today), Blocker/hindrances

			Planned meeting : invite people carefully, agenda, minutes, report on outcomes and actions
			




Progress At The Academy

	Lohminger 	

		Score behaviour

			Behaviour (actions)

			Technical Knowledge 

			Attitude (outlook mentally)

			Attributes (qualities about you)


	Behaviour

		Horsepower : raw ability to learn, progress, push through problems etc (tenacity)		

		Interpersonal : create and develop relationships

		Perseverance : overcome obstacles etc
	
		Self Development : how you take steps to progress your own knowledge

	Coding

		Functionality : Does code work???

		Readability : does code read well visually? appropriate comments?

		Reuse/Maintain

			DRY Don't Repeat Yourself!

				Loop 1 to 100

				Loop 1 to 1000


				or (better)				

				Loop(1 to max)
						
		Git / GitHub       
			Git : local

	Structure

		Slides - not too 'wordy'

		1. Intro
		2. Outline
		3. Topics
			
					Report vs Powerpoint
			
						Report : rule of 5 : Intro, Backgound to topic, 
							Transition into details, Fine detail, conclusion

						Powerpoint : rule of 3 : 3 sections/slides per topic

	KISS : Keep It Simple, Stupid!!!

	Tips for newbies

		Bottle of water : 'pause time' 

		Humour!
	


Project Management

	BAU Business As Usual		Regular run-of-mill-work

	Projects

		Unique
		Transient
					Inserted into workplace with definite goal
		
		Clear aim

			Phases

			Specialists

			Involve complexity

	Constraints on a project

		1) Balance 		TIME       vs         QUALITY           vs       COST


	POPIT IT Model

					people

			  		IT
			
			processes		 organisation
			(flow of work)            (company)






		

IT Projects : Examples of SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle

	Waterfall : simple, fixed projects

		First IT projects like this
		Fixed, unchanging : List of Requirements, Analyse, Design, Build, Test, Release	
		Good for manufacturing / military / small projects	
		
		V-model
			Waterfall + Extra Testing for mission-critical projects

	Agile : changing projects

		Check ' Agile Manifesto '
		
		IT : spectacular fails!!!  Design : too big + whole project : takes too long!!!	

		Solution : Don't design project fully in intricate detail up front.  Only design
			first simple prototype (( MVP Minimum Viable Product ))  (Sprint 1)
			Then => Sprint 2 : Add an INCREMENT OF FUNCTIONALITY!!!
			Sprint 3 : Next iteration etc
		
		Scrum : work in short increments (sprints)

			3-9 developers
			Daily 'stand up'
			Sprint is a focused piece of work

	Kanban : continuous flow

		Car manufacturing is 24/7

		Some industries better with 'flow' of work non-stop.

			Kanban 'board' list of tasks but limit 'number of tasks in progress at any
				one time'


	
	Proposing a new project

		Risk

			% chance that something will go wrong

				% Probability 'x' which will result in loss of impact 'y'

				20% chance market will collapse with loss of £1,000,000

		Cost  

		Timescale (Crossrail!!!)

		Approvers ???

		Stakeholders !!! (give account to)

			Investors 
		
		Cost-Benefit Analysis : How will it benefit our business?

			ROI : Return On Investment  (long term)

			




Advanced Communication

NLP Neuro		First responses ('first mental map'
			ie how you encounter world around you
			5 SENSES : Touch, smell, taste, sight , hear
    Linguistic 
			Learning : how you process information

    Programming		Action : what you DO!  

Bias
	
	tend to take sides based on our personal preference

		OBJECTIVE		FACTUAL, IMPARTIAL, UNBIASED

		SUBJECTIVE		OPINION BASED, CAN CHANGE

	Exam : cases which may cause bias

		Pressure of time : people tend not to think things through 
					carefully

		Money : lack of it : tends to cause pressured behaviour

		Lack of information / meaning / clarity : Poor decisions based
				on half-information
		
		Diversity issues

		Overwhelmed with choice : too much info!

		(human level) forget which can limit ability to make good 
				decisions (limitations of memory)

	Examples

		Anchoring bias : tend to choose 'first option'

		Choice-supportive : support option which you personally prefer				
		Confirmation bias : I've already reached my conclusion so
			the facts must fit my choice.

		Outcome bias : concerned about the consequences of a certain
				outcome rather than making a good, rational
				decision

	Reducing Bias

		6 'objective hats'   (De Bono Thinking Hats)

		White		pure facts only
		Yellow		optimistic choice
		Black		pessimist / negatives / dangers
		Red		emotional / feelings to do with this decision
		Green		creativity, creating opportunities from 				nothing
		Blue		rational decision

Programming Puzzle : Fizz-Buzz

	Count to 100

		If divisible by 3 ==> Print 'fizz'

		                5           'buzz'

				3 and 5     'fizzbuzz'

		Otherwise just print the number


		1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz

		divisible????

			/                        10/3  3.333
			% remainder (modulus)    10%3 = 10 divide by 3 and what is the remainder???  ==> 1

						 i%3 = 0  on 3,6,9
						 i%5 = 0  on 5,10,15

		Equals

			a=6    assigning 6 to a

			if(a==6)    does a equal 6???




Thursday : Review of work 

Loops

2 Triangles

		'Triple Constraint'           TIME VS QUALITY VS COST

					   People	
					
		POPIT			    Tech

				 Organisation        Processes
				(company)            (flow of info/data)

SDLC models

	Software Dev Life Cycle

Waterfall
	Simple, structured project which will NOT CHANGE!

V-Model

	Add to waterfall : extra testing at each stage

Agile
	builds 'MVP' minimum viable product ie first prototype, then 
		add functionality steadily each 'sprint'
	'manifesto' ==> value people, embrace change

	Scrum : Implementation of agile in a practical way
		'Sprints' : build fixed chosen new 'iteration' (improvement)
			Stand-up :  Did yesterday, Do today, 'blockers'	

	Customer : 'list of requirements' (product backlog)
		Sprint : choose one or two items to build (sprint backlog)

Kanban
	Continuous flow of work : limit work-in-progress at any one time!

	Backlog     Chosen For development       In development      Done

	lots         few                         5 max               

Time Management 

	Boxing : limit time on task, helps not to just run without end

	2 mins : just do it!

	1	Capture
	2	Organise
			Prioritise
	3. 	Do
			Plan , Track progress, Report 

Pareto : 20/80     

Underpromise / Overdeliver

Eisenhower 'box of tasks'
			URGENCY
			HIGH		LOW	

IMPORTANCE  HIGH	1 fire-fight	2 BEST PLACE 'high quality'
			  'necessity'

	LOW		3 not important		4. waste of time 	
			  (urgent but for
			  reasons often not
			  helpful to yourself) 
			    (deception)

Communication
	Cultural, geographical, working styles

	Verbal   	Content
	Vocal		How said, tone
	Visual		Body language


Listen types
	
	Passive : think about something else!	
	Conversational 
	Active : questions
	Deep
